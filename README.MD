 # Investigation into Net-code Solutions of Multiplayer Games
  
 The project is split into two branches, each with their own implementation of Netcode.
 
 ### Basic
 This branch contains the implementation of the Client-Authoritative Basic Lockstep netcode.
 
 ### Deterministic
 This branch contains the implementation of the Server-Authoritative Deterministic Lockstep netcode
 
 Each of the branches contains the same version of the proposal and poster, but for clarity sake, 
 Main branch is considered the best place to get the proposal and poster pdf.
